A set of macros for use with [J2BA's Animated Assets](https://www.jb2a.com). Many of these macros use effects from the Patreon version of the pack, but feel free to adjust them for use with the free assets available.


## Dependencies

- **MIDI QOL** for the 'On Use Macro' function it provides.
- **Sequencer**
- **J2BA's Animated Assets**
- **Automated Animations** As spells already covered by the default presets there are not included here.
- **WarpGate** For summons and spells like dancing lights, spiritual weapon, etc

## Usage
These macros are meant to be used in a spell or item's 'On Use Macro' field, that comes with MIDI QOL.
