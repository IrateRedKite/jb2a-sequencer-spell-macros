# JB2A Sequencer Macro Library

A set of macros for use with [JB2A's Animated Assets](https://www.jb2a.com) in Foundry VTT. Many of these macros use effects from the Patreon version of the pack, but feel free to adjust them for use with the free assets available.

## Dependencies

- [**MIDI QOL**](https://gitlab.com/tposney/midi-qol) for the 'On Use Macro' function it provides.
- [**Dynamic Active Effects**](https://gitlab.com/tposney/dae) for spells with visual effects that persist based on a condition.
- [**Sequencer**](https://github.com/fantasycalendar/FoundryVTT-Sequencer)
- [**J2BA's Animated Assets**](https://www.jb2a.com)
- [**WarpGate**](https://github.com/trioderegion/warpgate) For summons and spells like dancing lights, spiritual weapon, etc

## Usage

Most of these macros are meant to be used in the item 'On Use Macro' field that comes with MIDI QOL. A handful use the `macro.execute` effect key and are labelled as such.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute scripts to this repository, please feel free to submit a pull request! Ideally anything contributed should conform to the styles visible in the preview folders.
